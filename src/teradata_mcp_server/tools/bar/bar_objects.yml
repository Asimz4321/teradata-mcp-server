# BAR (Backup and Restore) Objects Configuration
# This file contains object definitions for BAR tools, prompts, and resources

# Note: The main BAR tools are implemented in bar_tools.py as they require
# complex HTTP API interactions with DSA systems that cannot be represented
# as simple SQL queries.

# Future BAR-related prompts and simple tools can be defined here
# following the standard YAML object format.
